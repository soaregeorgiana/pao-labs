/**
 * A Collection is a group of individual objects represented as a single unit. Java provides
 * Collection Framework which defines several classes and interfaces to represent a group of
 * objects as a single unit.
 * <p>
 * Collection
 * - provides all general purpose methods which all collections classes must support
 * (or throw UnsupportedOperationException), eg: add(E e), contains(Object o),
 * remove(Object o);
 * - extends Iterable interface which adds support for iterating over collection
 * elements using the “for-each loop” statement;
 * - all other collection interfaces and classes (except Map) either extend or
 * implement this interface, Eg: List (indexed, ordered) and Set (sorted) interfaces
 * implement this collection
