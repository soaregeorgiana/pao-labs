/**
 * An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event which occurs during the execution of
 * a program that disrupts the normal flow of that program
 * <p>
 * Error : indicates a serious problem that a reasonable application should not try to catch
 * Exception : indicates conditions that a reasonable application might try to catch.
 * <p>
 * The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanisms to handle the runtime errors
 * so that normal flow of the application can be maintained.
 * <p>
 * Exceptions are Java objects with all of them extending from Throwable. There are three main
 * categories of exceptions:
 * -> Checked exceptions: exceptions that the Java compiler requires us to handle (IOException, SQLException)
 * -> Unchecked exceptions / Runtime exceptions: exceptions that the Java compiler does not require us to handle (NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException)
 * -> Errors: even though they don't extend RuntimeException, they are also unchecked (StackOverflowError, OutOfMemoryError)
