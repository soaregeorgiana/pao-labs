DataInputStream class allows an application to read primitive data from the input stream.
Java application generally uses the data output stream to write data that can later be read by a data input stream.
BufferedInputStream provides transparent reading of chunks of bytes and buffering for a Java InputStream including any subclasses of InputStream:
Reading larger chunks of bytes and buffering them can speed up IO.
BufferedInputStream reads a larger block at a time into an internal buffer.
When you read a byte from the Java BufferedInputStream you are therefore reading it from its internal buffer.
When the buffer is fully read, the BufferedInputStream reads another larger block of data into the buffer.
This is much faster than reading a single byte at a time from an InputStream, especially for disk access and larger data amounts.
To add buffering to an InputStream simply wrap it in a BufferedInputStream
