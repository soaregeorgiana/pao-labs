/**
 * A lambda expression is characterized by the following syntax:
 * (A list of parameters separated by commas) -> {expression body which
 * contains one or more statements}
 * A lambda expression can be shortened in two ways because JDK compiler supports type
 * inference.
 * - Can omit the declaration of the parameter’s type. The compiler can infer it from the
 * parameter’s value.
 * - Can omit the return keyword if the expression body has a single expression.
 * A lambda expression can be simplified with the following conditions:
 * - Can omit the parenthesis for a single parameter.
 * - Can omit the curly brackets if the expression body only contains a single statement.
