 * Stream of Primitives:
 * - Since version 8 Java offers a possibility to create streams out of three primitive types:
 * int, long and double.
 * - As Stream<T> is a generic interface and there is no way to use primitives as a type
 * parameter with generics, three new special interfaces were created: I ntStream,
 * LongStream, DoubleStream.
