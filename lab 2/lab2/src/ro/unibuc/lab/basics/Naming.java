 * Class names should start with an uppercase letter and follow the rest of the rules for any identifier names

 * - can contain letters (both upper and lower case),
 * - can contain numbers but cannot start with them
 * - cannot contain spaces or any special characters except (the $ sign or _. )
 * - cannot be a keyword
 * Conventions for standardisation:
 * - variable names start with lowercase letters.
 * - if variable names contain multiple words, the first one is lowercase and each subsequent word start with only it's
 * first letter as an uppercase (camelCase)
