/**
 * Arrays
 * They provide an ordered collection of elements.
 * They can be defined in two ways.
 * - First one: int a[]; int c[], d; // here c is an array, while d is a simple int
 * - Second one: int[] b;
 * In order to allocate space: we use the keyword "new" and then int[3] to allocate space to store 3 int values
 * Each element is accessed via an index - and indexes range is from 0 to number of elements in the array minus 1
 * <p>
 * |9|8|7|
 * 0 1 2
 * <p>
 * lastIndex = x.length-1
