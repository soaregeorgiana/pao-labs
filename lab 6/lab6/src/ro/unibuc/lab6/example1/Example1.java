 * Before we can use an interface, we must implement that interface in some java class.
 * A class that implements an interface MUST implement all the abstract methods declared in the interface.
 * The abstract methods must have the exact same signature as declared in the interface
 * <p>
 * Once a Java class implements a Java interface we can use an instance of that class as an instance of that interface
 * We cannot create instances of a Java interfaces by itself.
 * We must always create an instance of some class that implements the interface, and reference that instance as an instance of the interface
